            <h1>Super Mario Bros Idea</h1>
            <p>A good idea for a super Mario Brothers game would be a game that is like the Mario and Luigi games of the past. An idea for it could be that Mario and Luigi able to move around in an open world and be able to fight in a 3D setting. They could be on a journy to rescue Princess Peach and Princess Daisy from an entety called Dark Matter, who is wanting to take over the world by plunging it into darkness. Mario and Luigi will have to collect the eight Light Crystals, which will allow them to defeat Dark Matter. They will have to explore diferent areas and defeat bosses in order to get a Light Crystal from that area.</p>
